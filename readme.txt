Project description:
Rhythm Keys is a rhythm game inspired by Guitar Hero.
The game allows the user to upload a MIDI audio file and generates
a chart of notes separated into some columns based on the information
in the MIDI file, the difficulty level the player selects,
and the instrument or part the player chooses to play. The player will press
the keys to the notes in time with the music. There are tokens,
obstacles, and attacks that can be added to the gameboard as well. 
The player can also create their own gameboard with their own music in the
create mode. The local multiplayer option allows up to four players to compete
using the same song and interfere with each other's gameboards.

How to run the app:
Run the App.py file in the main folder.
